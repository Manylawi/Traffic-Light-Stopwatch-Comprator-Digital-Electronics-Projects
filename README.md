# 🔌 Digital Electronics Projects — No Microcontroller

This repository showcases a set of digital electronics projects built entirely **without microcontrollers**. All logic is implemented using **basic components** such as logic gates, flip-flops, 555 timers, counters, and 7-segment displays.

These projects offer hands-on experience for engineering students and enthusiasts, demonstrating the practical application of **pure hardware logic** to solve real-world control problems.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. 🚦 Digital Traffic Light Controller

#### 👨‍🎓 Team Members:
- Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed Fouad El-Manylawi  
- Ahmed Reda Kamel Abdelghany  
- Ahmed Saeed Mohamed Imam Zayed  
- Esraa Hamdy Sayed Abdelsalam

**Faculty**: Faculty of Engineering – Helwan National University  
**Year**: 2024

#### 📘 Description:
This project simulates a **digital traffic light system** that counts down from 7 to 0 using a 7-segment display and then toggles between red and green LEDs — similar to real-world traffic light behavior.

#### ⚙️ Components:
- 555 Timer (Astable mode)
- JK Flip-Flops (3 for countdown, 1 for toggle)
- 7447 Decoder (BCD to 7-segment)
- NOR & NAND gates (logic control)
- 7-Segment Display
- Red and Green LEDs

### 2. ⏱️ Digital Stopwatch

#### 📘 Description:
A simple stopwatch circuit built using a 555 timer, counters (4026), and 7-segment displays to count and show elapsed seconds.

#### ⚙️ Components:
- 555 Timer  
- Counter ICs (4026)  
- 7-Segment Displays  

---

### 3. ⚖️ 3-Bit Digital Comparator

#### 📘 Description:
A digital logic circuit that compares two 3-bit binary numbers (A and B) and outputs:
- A > B  
- A = B  
- A < B  

#### ⚙️ Components:
- Not and OR logic gates  
- 7 segments to indicate comparison results
